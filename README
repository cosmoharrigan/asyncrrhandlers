Asynchronous request-reply single-threaded server in Python
that spawns a request handler each time a request is received

This is different from other examples because the number of request handler threads is not defined ahead of time.

Request:
Client DEALER --> Server ROUTER --> Request handler (spawned)
1. Clients send requests via a DEALER socket on port 5570
2. Server receives requests via a ROUTER socket on port 5570
3. Server passes both the request and the client identity directly to request handlers when they are spawned

Reply:
Client DEALER <-- Server ROUTER <-- Server DEALER <-- Request handler DEALER
1. Request handler returns the reply to the Server via a DEALER socket on inproc
2. Server receives the reply from the request handler via a DEALER socket on inproc
3. Server sends the reply to the client via a ROUTER socket on port 5570
4. Client receives the reply via a DEALER socket on port 5570
